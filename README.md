## 🎮️ Game overview

Open world Agumented reality game where the world is your ocean and you are the navigator of your virtual ship, combining gaming with the real world.
We would use location tracking and mapping technology to create an ‘augmented reality’ where players collect (Materials, Trash, Treassure) and build ship armour in real locations.
