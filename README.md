## 🎮️ Game overview

Open world Agumented reality game where the world is your ocean and you are the navigator of your virtual ship, combining gaming with the real world.
We would use location tracking and mapping technology to create an ‘augmented reality’ where players collect (Materials, Trash, Treassure) and build ship armour in real locations.
Players would resonate with the purpose of the NGO, by experiencing first hand and volunteer to clean the ocean and understand the cause!

## Gameplay

Levels

Since this game is about the progression of the sailor’s attempt to become one of the best, perhaps a more linear progression would help keep the player focused
directly toward the goal. As players reach new seas and routes, they will be able to gather resources either by collecting items, Saving Aquatic Creatures, or medals. Allowing for player choice is essential - so the player should be able to choose whether to play as a boy or girl. If the player chooses to play as a boy, gameplay will be almost similar to the girl’s gameplay. However, the appearance of the trainer’s head, shirt, pants, shoes, and hat will vary depending on the gender chosen.

Vicotry or Loss Conditions

The boy and girl’s victory conditions are exactly the same
Victory = Your Ship defeating all of the other Sailors / Pirate’s Ships.
